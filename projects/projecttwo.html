  <li><center>Everybody loves the things you do<br>
From the way you talk<br>
To the way you move<br>
Everybody here is watching you<br>
'Cause you feel like home<br>
You're like a dream come true<br>
But if by chance you're here alone<br>
Can I have a moment<br>
Before I go?<br>
'Cause I've been by myself all night long<br>
Hoping you're someone I used to know<br></li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>You look like a movie<br>
You sound like a song<br>
My God, this reminds me<br>
Of when we were young<br></li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>Let me photograph you in this light<br>
In case it is the last time<br>
That we might be exactly like we were<br>
Before we realized<br>
We were sad of getting old<br>
It made us restless<br>
It was just like a movie<br>
It was just like a song<br></li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>I was so scared to face my fears<br>
Nobody told me that you'd be here<br>
And I swore you moved overseas<br>
That's what you said, when you left me<br></li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>You still look like a movie<br>
You still sound like a song<br>
My God, this reminds me<br>
Of when we were young<br></li>
<br>
<br><li><center>Let me photograph you in this light<br>
In case it is the last time<br>
That we might be exactly like we were<br>
Before we realized<br>
We were sad of getting old<br>
It made us restless<br>
It was just like a movie<br>
It was just like a song<br></li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>When we were young<br>
When we were young<br>
When we were young<br>
When we were young<br></li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>It's hard to win me back<br>
Everything just takes me back<br>
To when you were there<br>
To when you were there<br>
And a part of me keeps holding on<br>
Just in case it hasn't gone<br>
I guess I still care<br>
Do you still care?<br></li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>It was just like a movie<br>
It was just like a song<br>
My God, this reminds me<br>
Of when we were young<br></li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>When we were young<br>
When we were young<br>
When we were young<br>
When we were young<br></li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>Let me photograph you in this light<br>
In case it is the last time<br>
That we might be exactly like we were<br>
Before we realized<br>
We were sad of getting old<br>
It made us restless<br>
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old<br>
It makes me reckless<br>
It was just like a movie<br>
It was just like a song<br>
When we were young</li>
