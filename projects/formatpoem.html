<h1><center>If You Forget Me</h1>

<ol>
  <li><center>I want you to know one thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>You know how this is: if I look at the crystal moon, at the red branch of the slow autumn at my window, if I touch near the fire<br>
  the impalpable ash or the wrinkled body of the log, everything carries me to you, as if everything that exists, aromas, light, metals, were<br>
  little boats that sail toward those isles of yours that wait for me.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>Well, now, if little by little you stop loving me I shall stop loving you little by little.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>If suddenly you forget me do not look for me, for I shall already have forgotten you.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>If you think it long and mad, the wind of banners that passes through my life, and you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart<br>
   where I have roots, remember that on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my arms and my roots will set off to seek another land.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li><center>But if each day, each hour, you feel that you are destined for me with implacable sweetness, if each day a flower climbs up to your lips<br>
   to seek me, ah my love, ah my own, in me all that fire is repeated, in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten, my love feeds on your<br>
    love, beloved, and as long as you live it will be in your arms without leaving mine</li>
