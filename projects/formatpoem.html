      <p><center>I want you to know
  one thing.</p>
</div>
  <div class="container2">
      <p><center>
      You know how this is:
      if I look
      at the crystal moon, at the red branch
      of the slow autumn at my window,
      if I touch
      near the fire
      the impalpable ash
      or the wrinkled body of the log,<br>
      everything carries me to you,
      as if everything that exists,
      aromas, light, metals,
      were little boats
      that sail
      toward those isles of yours that wait for me.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container3">
      <p><center>
      Well, now,
      if little by little you stop loving me
      I shall stop loving you little by little.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container4">
      <p><center>
      If suddenly
      you forget me
      do not look for me,
      for I shall already have forgotten you.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container5">
      <p><center>
      If you think it long and mad,
      the wind of banners
      that passes through my life,
      and you decide
      to leave me at the shore
      of the heart where I have roots,
      remember
      that on that day,<br>
      at that hour,
      I shall lift my arms
      and my roots will set off
      to seek another land.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container6">
      <p><center>
      But
      if each day,
      each hour,
      you feel that you are destined for me
      with implacable sweetness,
      if each day a flower
      climbs up to your lips to seek me,
      ah my love, ah my own,<br>
      in me all that fire is repeated,
      in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
      my love feeds on your love, beloved,
      and as long as you live it will be in your arms
      without leaving mine</p>
