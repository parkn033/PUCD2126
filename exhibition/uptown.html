      <h1>“How to Work Better”</h1>
      <h2>Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum</h2>
      <p>The Guggenheim’s survey of the renowned Swiss artistic duo Peter Fischli and David Weiss revealed that their work was far greater than the sum of its prankster parts.

That much was made clear by The Met’s intriguing “Crime Stories: Photography and Foul Play,” a small show big on gory details. Presenting a rogues’ gallery of mug shots, crime-scene photos, tabloid images and works of art illustrating the criminal act’s hold on the imagination, the exhibit presented a history of photography’s relationship with law enforcement—and demonstrated just how much the medium enables our prurient fascination with murder and mayhem.

    <h2>Cooper Hewitt Museum</h2>
    <p>Offering creative, alternative approaches to confronting textile waste, Scraps: Fashion, Textiles, and Creative Reuse presents the work of three designers who put sustainability at the heart of the design process: Luisa Cevese, founder of Riedzioni in Milan; Christina Kim, founder of dosa, inc., in Los Angeles; and Reiko Sudo, managing director at NUNO in Tokyo. Each designer’s practice involves innovative and sophisticated reuse of textile materials and resources, while engaging in preservation of local craft traditions. Through more than forty works, the exhibition explores key facets of sustainability.
