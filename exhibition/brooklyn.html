      <h2>MOMA PS1</h2>
      <p>A.K. Burns: Shabby but Thriving” marks a new chapter in artist A.K. Burns’ serial work drawing on theater, science fiction, philosophy, and ecological anxieties.

      <h1>“Marilyn Minter: Pretty/Dirty”</h1>
      <h2>Brooklyn Museum</h2>
      <p>Minter had already been working in New York for 30 years before her career breakout in the 2006 Whitney Biennial, and in the ensuing decade, she dialed up her exploration of how women are objectified by fashion and the media to a Nigel Tufnel–worthy 11. Focusing on various details of the female anatomy, Minter’s photos and hyper-realist paintings demolish our notions of beauty and femininity with increasingly garish élan. Her success has been hard won, but as the Brooklyn Museum’s provocative retrospective of her work showed, richly deserved.

      <h1>“Projects 105: Cinthia Marcelle”</h1>
      <h2>MOMA PS1</h2>
      <p>For Projects 105, MoMA PS1 presents Education by Stone (2016), a new site-specific installation by Cinthia Marcelle (born Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 1974) and the artist’s first solo exhibition in New York. Marcelle is known for installations, performances, and videos that stage forms of labor to produce poetic situations. The installation introduces chalk, a traditional teaching material to which Marcelle has returned throughout her career, into the Duplex gallery of MoMA PS1—which is itself a former school building. Numerous rods of chalk will be lodged into the fissures and openings of the gallery’s brick walls from floor to ceiling, revealing the material’s inherent instability and fragility.
