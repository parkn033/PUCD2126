      <h1>"Francis Picabia: Our Heads are Round so Our Thoughts Can Change Direction”</h1>
      <h2>Museum of Modern Art (MOMA)</h2>
      <p>Francis Picabia is the Playboy Prankster of Modernism. Make way for Francis Picabia, one of the grandest, most mordant exemplars of early modernism, and perhaps the least familiar. The Museum of Modern Art — having for decades drummed the artistic feats of Picasso, Matisse, Mondrian and Duchamp into cultural consciousness — has finally rolled out the red carpet for this capricious, prolific, subversive fellow traveler.

    <h1>“Marilyn Minter: Pretty/Dirty”</h1>
    <h2>Brooklyn Museum</h2>
    <p>Minter had already been working in New York for 30 years before her career breakout in the 2006 Whitney Biennial, and in the ensuing decade, she dialed up her exploration of how women are objectified by fashion and the media to a Nigel Tufnel–worthy 11. Focusing on various details of the female anatomy, Minter’s photos and hyper-realist paintings demolish our notions of beauty and femininity with increasingly garish élan. Her success has been hard won, but as the Brooklyn Museum’s provocative retrospective of her work showed, richly deserved.

    <h1>“Crime Stories: Photography and Foul Play”</h1>
    <h2>Metropolitan Museum of Art</h2>
    <p>Crime may or may not pay, but it sure knows how to grab your attention. That much was made clear by The Met’s intriguing “Crime Stories: Photography and Foul Play,” a small show big on gory details. Presenting a rogues’ gallery of mug shots, crime-scene photos, tabloid images and works of art illustrating the criminal act’s hold on the imagination, the exhibit presented a history of photography’s relationship with law enforcement—and demonstrated just how much the medium enables our prurient fascination with murder and mayhem.

    <h1>“How to Work Better”</h1>
    <h2>Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum</h2>
    <p>The Guggenheim’s survey of the renowned Swiss artistic duo Peter Fischli and David Weiss revealed that their work was far greater than the sum of its prankster parts. Employing photography, sculpture and video, Fischli and Weiss built on Marcel Duchamp’s readymade legacy to ruminate on the everyday and how we deal with it, framing experience as a dialectic of minor epiphanies and incidental absurdities. This look at their career was one of the best shows at the Gugg in recent memory.

    <h1>“Stuart Davis: In Full Swing”</h1>
    <h2>Whitney Museum of American Art</h2>
    <p>The emergence of America art during 20th-century art has often been treated as a version of Clark Kent turning into Superman—a tale of mild-mannered cultural backwater transformed into the invincible art capital of the world following World War II. The Whitney offered a different view with its retrospective of Stuart Davis, The Jazz Age American Modernist whose work turns out to be as important as anything produced after 1945. With their references to street signage, Davis’s brightly colored paintings anticipated Pop Art, but more importantly, they captured the spirit, energy and chaos of life.

    <h1>“SCRAPS: FASHION, TEXTILES AND CREATIVE REUSE”</h1>
    <h2>Cooper Hewitt Museum</h2>
    <p>Offering creative, alternative approaches to confronting textile waste, Scraps: Fashion, Textiles, and Creative Reuse presents the work of three designers who put sustainability at the heart of the design process: Luisa Cevese, founder of Riedzioni in Milan; Christina Kim, founder of dosa, inc., in Los Angeles; and Reiko Sudo, managing director at NUNO in Tokyo. Each designer’s practice involves innovative and sophisticated reuse of textile materials and resources, while engaging in preservation of local craft traditions. Through more than forty works, the exhibition explores key facets of sustainability.

    <h1>“Projects 105: Cinthia Marcelle”</h1>
    <h2>MOMA PS1</h2>
    <p>For Projects 105, MoMA PS1 presents Education by Stone (2016), a new site-specific installation by Cinthia Marcelle (born Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 1974) and the artist’s first solo exhibition in New York. Marcelle is known for installations, performances, and videos that stage forms of labor to produce poetic situations. The installation introduces chalk, a traditional teaching material to which Marcelle has returned throughout her career, into the Duplex gallery of MoMA PS1—which is itself a former school building. Numerous rods of chalk will be lodged into the fissures and openings of the gallery’s brick walls from floor to ceiling, revealing the material’s inherent instability and fragility.

    <h1>“RAYMOND PATTIBON: A PEN OF ALL WORK”</h1>
    <h2>New Museum</h2>
    <p>For over thirty years, Raymond Pettibon (b. 1957, Tucson, AZ) has been chronicling the history, mythology, and culture of America with a prodigious and distinctive voice. Through his drawings’ signature interplay between image and text, he moves between historical reflection, emotional longing, poetic wit, and strident critique. Since the late 1960s, he has produced thousands of drawings and energetic installations that have been executed in museums and galleries around the world.

    <h1>“Fast Forward: Paintings from the 1980s”</h1>
    <h2>Whitney Museum of American Art</h2>
    <p>In the 1980s, painting recaptured the imagination of the contemporary art world against a backdrop of expansive change. An unprecedented number of galleries appeared on the scene, particularly in downtown New York. Groundbreaking exhibitions—that blurred distinctions between high and low art—were presented at alternative and artist-run spaces. New mediums, including video and installation art, were on the rise. Yet despite the growing popularity of photography and video, many artists actively embraced painting, freely exploring its bold physicality and unique capacity for expression and innovation.
