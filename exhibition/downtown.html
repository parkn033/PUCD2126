      <h1>“RAYMOND PATTIBON: A PEN OF ALL WORK”</h1>
      <h2>New Museum</h2>
      <p>For over thirty years, Raymond Pettibon (b. 1957, Tucson, AZ) has been chronicling the history, mythology, and culture of America with a prodigious and distinctive voice. Through his drawings’ signature interplay between image and text, he moves between historical reflection, emotional longing, poetic wit, and strident critique. Since the late 1960s, he has produced thousands of drawings and energetic installations that have been executed in museums and galleries around the world.

      <h1>“Stuart Davis: In Full Swing”</h1>
      <h2>Whitney Museum of American Art</h2>
      <p>The emergence of America art during 20th-century art has often been treated as a version of Clark Kent turning into Superman—a tale of mild-mannered cultural backwater transformed into the invincible art capital of the world following World War II. The Whitney offered a different view with its retrospective of Stuart Davis, The Jazz Age American Modernist whose work turns out to be as important as anything produced after 1945. With their references to street signage, Davis’s brightly colored paintings anticipated Pop Art, but more importantly, they captured the spirit, energy and chaos of life.

      <h1>“Fast Forward: Paintings from the 1980s”</h1>
      <h2>Whitney Museum of American Art</h2>
      <p>In the 1980s, painting recaptured the imagination of the contemporary art world against a backdrop of expansive change. An unprecedented number of galleries appeared on the scene, particularly in downtown New York. Groundbreaking exhibitions—that blurred distinctions between high and low art—were presented at alternative and artist-run spaces. New mediums, including video and installation art, were on the rise. Yet despite the growing popularity of photography and video, many artists actively embraced painting, freely exploring its bold physicality and unique capacity for expression and innovation.
