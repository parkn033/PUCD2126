          Scarred bodies, distorted faces, sagging breasts, and androids are where I initially derived my inspiration for my artwork.  I grew up in a society where a mix of media influences and demand for “beautiful” appearances have dominated the social norm.  According to an article by Business Insider, approximately 20% of women have had some sort of plastic surgery procedure in an attempt to look like celebrities they see on television daily.  Such culture has not only warped the physical appearances of people in Korea but has also created a machinelike mindset to act, think, and behave as “plastic” as possible.  The restrictions of a society that embraces uniformity and rejects uniqueness have always been oppressive to me, a person who gives originality and expression the utmost priority.  It is that very uniqueness that gives me passion for art and guides the expression of my beliefs and opinion into the works I create.
          Yves Saint Laurent once said, “Fashion fades but style is eternal.” When I first heard this statement, I felt it engrave into my soul as an artist.  It dawned on me that this quote clarified every doubt I had about my personality’s demand for originality.  It resounded to me as a statement that justified my abhorrence of fake societal demands. It was a message that my personal style was everlasting while these “plastic” people lived in a quickly fading fad.  My drive as an artist doesn’t rely on trends or fashions but on unique style.  After hearing Laurent’s quote, I have always dedicated myself to the expression of innovation.  I believe that each artist has their own method of conveying their messages; some through beautiful paintings and others through abstract art.  Personally, I attempt to express myself in an intensive and intrusive way.  I avoid dull graphite still-lifes for a more aggressive form that uses a medley of painting, engraving, stamping, and various other techniques. I often unrelentingly piece techniques, emotions, and ideas together until I am satisfied that my work has fully conveyed the depth of my voice and can serve as a catalyst to blatantly strike others with my message.

          After delving into art, I have developed my path from both my personality grating against society’s demand for conformity and Laurent’s quote, which pushed me into creating my own unique style of vivid clarity and force. The combination of the two has led me to pursue fashion as art.  Fashion has introduced me to a new canvas to shine on a daily basis, my body.  I continuously modify myself through clothes, accessories, and piercings, each having its own unique meaning, into what will eventually become my last masterpiece.  Though I can freely express myself, I find that I am still lacking a complete skill set to perfectly express myself.  At Parsons, I wish to broaden my scope under designers such as Anna Kiper; not only to become a better fashion designer, but to develop a distinct style that will never fade. Parson’s can provide a powerful program to help me mature as an artist and diversify my style through programs such as the study abroad program to Paris, the fashion capital of the world. I believe I will be able to succeed as a unique designer upon graduation and shatter the brainwashing effects of media culture.
